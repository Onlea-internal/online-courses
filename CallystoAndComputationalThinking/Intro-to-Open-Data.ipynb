    "\n",
    "Objectively speaking, yes. Whatever question you're looking to answer, not all open data are easy to work with! \n",
    "\n",
    "### What to look for with open data \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the data is in multiple files: is it consistently labeled, or easy to relate the quantities between files? \n",
    "![file labels](http://www.cybera.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Open-data-notebook-label-example.png)\n",
    "1. Is the data in a format that's easy to load on your computer (such as `csv`, `txt`, `json`), or open in Excel?\n",
    "     * A nicely formatted website HTML table works well!  \n",
    " ![html table](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TXh8D.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you're looking at spacial data: are the GPS coordinates already included (where relevant)?   \n",
    " ![gps coordinates](https://blog.batchgeo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/wikipedia-latitude-longitude.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the dataset complete? \n",
    "    * If values are missing, is there a good reason for that, and are they clearly labelled as missing?\n",
    "![missing values](https://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2Fa06%2Fa06ec409-9969-49bc-ba79-ff006fb92b21%2FphpokoeJU.png)\n",
    "1. Is the data regularly maintained?\n",
    "    * There should be some mention on the download page if it is, or there should at least be a time stamp of when it was last updated.\n",
    " ![timestamp](http://www.cybera.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/whitehorse-data.jpg)\n",

    "### Reliable sources\n",
    "Some online data sets are intentionally misleading or simply incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much like any other information source, open data is also affected by any biases of its curator. It is important to try and find unbiased data sources, or at least multiple sources of data that have alternate biases. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you're looking to study the heath affects of tobacco, a dataset provided by a study funded by a tobacco company may have different results than an independent study. Be aware of your data's origins before you draw any major conclusions from it! \n",

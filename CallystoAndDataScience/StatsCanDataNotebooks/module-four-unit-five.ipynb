    "We will guide the visualizations in this notebook based on the following guideline:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Define a Clear Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in answering the questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What outdoor activities to Canadians engage in? \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Are there activities more popular than others across Canadian cities? \n",
    "\n",
    "3. What percentage of Canadians engage in each of the different outdoor activities in 2011, 2013, 2015 and 2017? \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Know the Audience\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume our audience is fluent in English, and has an understanding of what a province is, as well as what the different provinces in Canada are. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Use Visual Features to Show the Data Properly\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualizations we will use include: bar graphs to quantify average percentage of activity across all selected years, as well as line graphs to showcase the top ten cities in which a given activity is popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Keep It Organized and Coherent\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to ask yourself: Does your visualization look cluttered? Are you mixing data categories? Are you attempting to answer more than one question using a single visualization? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Make Data Visualization Inclusive\n",
    "Questions to ask yourself: What are colour-blind-friendly colour palettes? Are you using them in your visualizations? If not, how can you incorporate them? Is the size of the visualization elements appropriate? What language does your audience use to communicate? Are there potential biases in your visualization that can be addressed? \n",
